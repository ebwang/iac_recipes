# Playbook deploy-docker-compose

Guys i usually do my deployments with jenkins using this script that change the docker-tag of docker-compose.
The docker-compose needs to pre-exist before the scripts run docker-compose-{{ application }}.yaml, and i want to program a condition to view if exist.
There are some files that are mounted inside of containers of docker-compose(The files which is copied)
So all the environments are passed by Jenkins pipe. and i'm going to share soon.
I used the ec2 inventory to limit some instances but you can pass with file.
